# Dollar_Calculator
Program that calculates dollar with the value in real time.  

OBS: Requires internet.  

The program converts real to dollar and dollar to real, at the end of the calculations it stores the results in a txt.  

The program was made with Python, using the PysimpleGUI library for interface and requests to consume a website link, making it look like an improvised API.
